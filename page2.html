    <h1>WHAT IS CSS?</h1>
    <P>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. <br>
        CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. <br>
        CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</P>
        <h2>Three Ways to Insert CSS </h2>
           <p>There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:</p>
            
            <h3> External CSS </h3> 
            <p>With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file! <br>
                Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, <br> inside the head section.</p>
            
                <h3> Internal CSS </h3>
            <p>An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. <br>
                The internal style is defined inside the style element, inside the head section. <br> <br>
            
                <h3>Inline CSS </h3>
            <p>An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. <br>
                To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. <br> The style attribute can contain any CSS property.</p>
                
                <h3>CSS Selectors:</h3>
                <p>CSS Selectors
                    CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style. <br>
                   <p> We can divide CSS selectors into five categories: </p>
                    
                    <li>Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)</li>
                    <li>Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)</li>
                    <li>Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)</li>
                    <li>Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)</li>
                    <li>Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)</li>

                    
                    </p>
